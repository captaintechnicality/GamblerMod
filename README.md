# Gambler Mod
This is the development repo for the Gambler Mod, a Slay the Spire mod which plans to add a new character called the Gambler to Slay the Spire.

The mod is currently under development, so the majority of art is temporary while I develop and test the cards.

## Mechanics
* Poker hands
  * Character's main relic gives reward cards based on poker hands.
  * Many cards can manipulate the hand to give better rewards.
* Money is key
  * Character starts with extra money
  * Many cards can give money.
  * Many cards spend money as part of their cost.
